        "description": "\n      1. Introduction\n      Climate change is expected to result in higher average temperatures and an increased intensity and frequency of heat waves, thereby increasing the adverse effects of high temperatures. For example, it has been reported that the average temperature on land where humans reside was projected to be 0–6 °C higher in the summer of 2021 than that in the years 1986–2005. Moreover, an increase in the number of heat-wave days experienced by children under the age of 1 year and adults over the age of 65 years, which are the age groups vulnerable to high temperatures, has been observed. These phenomena are anticipated to cause heat-related diseases (e.g., heat stroke) and are considered as indicators of the adverse effects of climate change on human health [1,2,3]. Visual climate change data are available at https://www.lancetcountdown.org/data-platform/ (accessed on 1 August 2023).\n      High-temperature environments impose stress on organisms and cause various cellular changes. Heat stress (HS, also known as heat shock or hyperthermia) is an environmental stress that occurs when organisms and cells are exposed to abnormally high temperatures, which are thought to increase with climate change. HS has diverse effects on the elements that form cells [4]. At the cellular level, it causes the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria, which are cellular organelles, and promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [5,6]. Additionally, it causes physical changes in the biomembrane, such as changes in membrane fluidity [7]. HS exerts various effects at the molecular level; for example, it can inhibit DNA repair pathways and cause DNA damage [8,9,10]. HS can also denature intracellular proteins and lead to their aggregation [11].\n      A programmed gene expression response called the heat shock response (HSR) is a cellular response to HS. The HSR is primarily regulated by a group of transcription factors called heat shock factors (HSFs); of them, HSF1 plays a central role in the response. When triggered by HS, HSF1 forms a trimer and binds to heat shock elements (HSEs) in DNA, which induces the expression of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs). The main HSP members are important proteins that function as molecular chaperones and maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis) by interacting with other proteins, stabilizing them, and helping them to acquire functional conformations. These members are mainly classified as HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, HSP100, and sHSPs (small HSPs), and they allow cells to maintain proteostasis and survive [12,13,14].\n      To date, HS-related studies have primarily focused on proteins that function as molecular chaperones, accumulating knowledge regarding their role in maintaining cell proteostasis and protecting cells under stress conditions, including heat stress. However, heat affects numerous cellular components [4]; moreover, proteins induced by heat stress have been proposed to be classified into functional classes such as nucleic acids and metabolism [12]. Despite this classification, limited studies have been available on the genes encoding these proteins induced by HS. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis, including previously uncharacterized or poorly known HS-related genes, is essential to deeply understand the heat stress response.\n      One approach to solving this problem is data-driven research using meta-analysis. Meta-analysis is a research method that integrates the results of multiple studies to obtain new insights. Specifically, a meta-analysis of gene expression data has been made possible by the increasing amount of data accumulated in public databases and by developing comprehensive methods for analyzing data from multiple studies [15]. This approach has led to the meta-analysis of gene expression data focused on various phenomena and species.\n      For example, meta-analyses incorporating a medical perspective have focused on hypoxia and oxidative stress. These studies collected, integrated, and analyzed human transcriptome data, abundant in public databases, to identify novel genes and pathways involved in responses to these specific stressors [16,17]. The importance of meta-analysis has also been pointed out in basic biology [18]. In addition to contributing to medical insight research, studies focusing on hypoxia in rice and Arabidopsis [19], as well as density-dependent polyphenism in insects [20], have demonstrated the versatility of meta-analysis, expanding its application across a diverse range of organism species and phenomena. Furthermore, attempts are being made to combine gene expression data with data from ChIP-seq and previous information from the existing literature to gain deeper insights [15,16].\n      Given this background, this study aimed to analyze genes involved in heat stress (HS) by collecting HS-related gene expression data from public databases on humans and mice and performing a meta-analysis. Unlike previous hypothesis-driven studies, this approach may yield novel insights into the mechanisms underlying HS. The dataset collected in this study and the selected gene set will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of organisms’ responses to HS.\n    "

        "description": "\n      Introduction\n      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) consist of 20–30 bases and play an important role in fostering communication among cells in various organisms (1). Tumor cells also affect the surrounding normal cells via miRNAs, encouraging changes in the tumor microenvironment to facilitate tumor progression (2–6). These miRNAs have been reported to be transmitted to the target cells via tumor-derived small extracellular vesicles (3–6). Thus, these miRNAs in circulating blood may be useful as prognostic or diagnostic markers of tumors (7–11).\n      Sarcoma is a rare cancer, and osteosarcoma typically occurs in children, adolescents and young adults (12,13). Thus far, the diagnosis of osteosarcoma has generally depended on the histological findings of a biopsy specimen. The prognosis of these patients has been reported to be associated with the presence of metastasis at presentation, a delayed initiation of treatment, a poor response to chemotherapy and small amounts of mature osteoclasts in biopsy specimens (14–19). Compared with these factors, however, circulating biomarkers assessed using blood tests are simpler and easier to evaluate, especially in children. Previously, several serum miRNAs associated with the prognosis or diagnosis of osteosarcoma have been reported, including circulating miR-663a, miR-25-3p, miR-487a, miR-493-5p, miR-501-3p and miR-502-5p (20–25).\n      In our previous study, osteosarcoma advanced locally and metastasis was promoted through the secretion of large number of small extracellular vesicles, followed by the suppression of osteoclastogenesis via the upregulation of miR-146a-5p (26). Several other miRNAs were also identified (miR-1260a, miR-487b-3p, miR-6720-3p, miR-1260b, miR-4758-3p, miR-4690-3p, miR-4286, miR-6765-3p, miR-1261, miR-7975, miR-4664-5p and miR-3907) that were included in small extracellular vesicles derived from high-grade osteosarcoma cells with the capacity to metastasize at rates ≥6× than in those with low metastatic potential (26). However, to the best of our knowledge, the utility of the 13 identified miRNAs for determining the prognosis or diagnosis of high-grade osteosarcoma has not yet been validated in the clinical setting.\n      Therefore, in the present study, the association of these miRNAs with the prognosis of patients with osteosarcoma and their potential utility in the diagnosis of osteosarcoma and differentiation from other bone tumors was investigated.\n    "
