        "description": "**Abstract**Climate change is leading to increased average temperatures and more frequent and intense heat waves, which pose significant health risks, particularly to vulnerable populations such as infants and the elderly. Heat stress (HS) is a critical environmental stressor that can cause a range of cellular and molecular changes, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, and protein denaturation. The heat shock response (HSR) is a well-characterized cellular defense mechanism regulated by heat shock factors (HSFs), with HSF1 being a key player. This response leads to the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which function as molecular chaperones to maintain protein homeostasis.Despite the knowledge of HSPs and their roles in cell protection under HS, there is a need for a more comprehensive understanding of the genes involved in HS responses. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a meta-analysis of gene expression data from public databases for humans and mice. By integrating results from multiple studies, this research seeks to identify novel genes and pathways involved in HS, providing new insights into the cellular mechanisms of HS and potentially contributing to the development of interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on human health.**Keywords:** Climate change, Heat stress, Heat shock response, Heat shock proteins, Meta-analysis, Gene expression, Public databases, Human health.---**1. Introduction**Climate change is expected to exacerbate the frequency and intensity of heat waves, leading to higher average temperatures, particularly in regions where humans live. This trend is associated with an increase in heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke, especially among vulnerable age groups like children under one year and adults over 65 years. The Lancet Countdown's data platform provides visual evidence of these climate change impacts.At the cellular level, HS can disrupt mitochondrial function, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, alter membrane fluidity, inhibit DNA repair, and cause protein aggregation. The heat shock response (HSR) is a cellular defense mechanism against HS, primarily regulated by heat shock factors (HSFs), with HSF1 playing a pivotal role. HSF1 activation leads to the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which are crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and cell survival.While the role of HSPs as molecular chaperones is well-documented, there is less known about other genes that are induced by HS. A comprehensive analysis of these genes is necessary for a deeper understanding of the HS response.Meta-analysis of gene expression data has emerged as a powerful tool to integrate findings from multiple studies and uncover new insights. This approach has been applied to various biological and medical research areas, including hypoxia and oxidative stress responses in humans, plants, and insects. By combining gene expression data with other datasets, such as ChIP-seq, and existing literature, researchers can gain a more profound understanding of the cellular responses to stressors.This study aims to perform a meta-analysis of HS-related gene expression data from humans and mice to identify genes involved in HS. This data-driven research may reveal novel insights into the mechanisms of HS and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the organismal response to this stressor."

        "Article_title": "A validation study for the utility of serum microRNA as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in patients with osteosarcoma",
        "description": "The introduction provided outlines the context and rationale for a study investigating the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer that primarily affects children, adolescents, and young adults. Here's a breakdown of the key points from the introduction:1. **Role of miRNAs**: miRNAs are short strands of RNA that play a crucial role in cell communication. They can influence the tumor microenvironment by being transmitted between cells, including from tumor cells to normal cells, via small extracellular vesicles.2. **miRNAs as Biomarkers**: Because miRNAs can be found in circulating blood, they have the potential to serve as non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of tumors, including osteosarcoma.3. **Osteosarcoma Background**: Osteosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that typically occurs in younger individuals. Diagnosis has traditionally relied on histological examination of biopsy specimens, and prognosis is influenced by several factors, including the presence of metastasis, response to chemotherapy, and characteristics of the tumor microenvironment.4. **Previous Findings**: Prior research has identified several serum miRNAs that may be associated with the prognosis or diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Additionally, the authors' previous study found that osteosarcoma progression and metastasis are associated with the secretion of small extracellular vesicles containing specific miRNAs, including miR-146a-5p, which suppresses osteoclastogenesis.5. **Study Aim**: The current study aims to investigate the association of 13 miRNAs identified in the authors' previous research with the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. It also seeks to explore the potential of these miRNAs as diagnostic tools for osteosarcoma and to differentiate it from other bone tumors.The introduction sets the stage for a study that could have significant implications for the management of osteosarcoma, offering the possibility of less invasive diagnostic methods and new insights into the disease's progression. The findings could lead to improved outcomes for patients through earlier diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies based on miRNA profiles."
